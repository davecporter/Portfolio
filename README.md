### Coding Skill Highlights

R: 
- dplyr: including advanced functions eg mutate_at, mutate_if
- tidyr & purrr: group, nest, map function
- ggplot: high quality figures
- complex multipurpose function creation e.g. `test_relationship()` in [`linear_regression.Rmd`](linear_regression.Rmd)

Python: 
- packages: numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn, statsmodels
