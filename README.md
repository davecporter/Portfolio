- R: Exercises from *Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*.
- R: Further investigation of machine learning algorithmn theory: linear regression, logistic regression and K nearest neighbours.
- R: Predicting survival on Titanic, the infamous dataset.
- Python: Analysis of FIFA national football team rankings.
- Python **?and R?**: Who would have won the English Premier League if it were organised as a round-robin tournament?
  - R: Data analysis and prediction of greenhouse gas emissions. Will various countries meet their Paris Accord targets?

### Skills  

...packages including...
R: 
  - dplyr: including helper functions eg mutate_at, select_if **CHECK THESE!**
  - ggplot: high quality figures
- purrr: grouping and nesting of data
Python: numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn



1. Data analysis and prediction of greenhouse gas emissions. Will various countries meet their Paris Accord targets?
  Skip to Section 4 for the juicy predictions using linear regression and time series modelling.

2. Prediction of movie popularity using multiple linear regression.


### Notes

ISLR ex stuff:
- markdowns not intended to be knitted

ML theory stuff:
- Functions are designed for the datasets used in this portfolio and haven't been extensively tested for universal use.
- Chart legends haven't been optimised, main focus is on the theory not spending time tarting these up
